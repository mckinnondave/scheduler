# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single page application (SPA) built using React.

Interviews can be booked during Monday and Friday, and a user can either edit/delete their bookings. The client application communicates with an API server over HTTP and users data is persisted by the API server using a PostgreSQL database.

This project was built through instruction from Lighthouse Labs
